# Isabelle-LLVM Parallel

Note: this distribution has been copied and adapted from the original Isabelle-LLVM framework.

Isabelle-LLVM Parallel is a verification framework for Isabelle/HOL that targets LLVM as backend.
It adds parallel execution to the original [Isabelle LLVM](http://www21.in.tum.de/~lammich/isabelle_llvm/).

For build instructions and starting points to browse the theories, see [html/index.html].
